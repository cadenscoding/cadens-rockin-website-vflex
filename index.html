      <p>Caden is an avid outdoorswoman, with four years of backcountry experience and over 500 miles hiked yearly. She is best suited to a life without indoor plumbing, electricity or running water. If Amish people allowed new members she would surely join. </p>
      <p>Currently Caden is taking classes on basketry and is enrolled in a trauma informed yoga teacher training, two skills she has always wanted to improve upon.</p>
      <p>She can normally be found outdoors with a book or listening to a Joni Mitchell song. She loves creek baths and pressing flowers. Her favorite day of the week is when she gets to go to the neighboring farm for fresh milk. She loves birds, her favorite being varities of waterfowl. </p>
