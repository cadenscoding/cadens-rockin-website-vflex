  <p class="do">These are some of my favorite things to do as spring turns to summer, but I am always trying to learn new skills and gain hobbies. They are what make life enjoyable! This winter I tried skiing for the first time and loved it! However, since I live basically in the South right now the opportunities to ski are few and far between because we no longer get snow.</p>
  <div class="climb" id="climb">
    <h3>Rock Climbing</h3>
    <p>Although I am a bit of a scaredy cat climber, rock climbing is one of my favorite things to do. The bodily awareness and trust it builds has been crucial to my healing process. More often than not I end up on belay...everyone needs a soft catch!</p>

  <div class="canoe" id="canoe">
    <h3>Canoeing</h3>
    <p>Nothing is better than a day (or more) on the water. I also have a kayak and SUP.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="camp" id="camp">

    <h3>Backpacking/Camping</h3>
    <p> My dream is to live my whole life in the woods. To me, nothing is better than sleeping on the ground with no one else around. I have hiked the Tahoe trail, the High Sierra trail, and attempted the Colorado trail. My next bucket list backpacking trip is the 100 Mile Wilderness in Maine! I typically camp over half of the year, in all four seasons.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="trip" id="trip">
    <h3>Road Trips!</h3>
    <p>When I first gained my freedom I planned a bucket list road trip, spanning multiple states and lasting many months. I didn't yet have a license or a car, but the prospect of an epic roadtrip kept me going. Eventually this turned into a love affair with van-life. I have since found more stability in my living situation but I will always love packing the car and heading to the woods with all my gear.</p>

  <div class="poke" id="poke">
    <h3>Acupuncture</h3>
    <p>My partner is an aspiring acupuncturist, and I find it to be incredibly centering. It is one of my favorite things to do when the opportunity arises. Recently a community acupuncture clininc opened in my town, and I love my practioner!</p>
