  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>My name is Caden, I am 22 years old an a Sagittarius. My favorite color is purple. I have one younger sister who is my favorite person on Earth even though we are 8 years apart. I am married but not legally, as we made our own contract and had it notarized to keep the government out of our personal life as much as possible. Currently, I am trying to build and move into a yurt. I love livestock but (unpopular opinion) can't stand having pets. I aspire to live self sufficiently, off-grid.</p>
